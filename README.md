# Simulations of Backoff Process
- Made simulations of the backoff process in multi-hop wireless networks;
- Modeled data packages with 1 or L slot time transmission;
- Investigated the throughput behavior as a function of different contention window;
- Explored how one node’s contention window impacts its throughput and system’s fairness.

Technics: MATLAB
